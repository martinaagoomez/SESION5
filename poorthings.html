                <p class="text3">
                    It's Victorian London, and Bella lives in a tasteful townhouse with the mad scientist who also serves as her father figure. As Dr. Godwin Baxter offers a gentle presence beneath his scarred visage. Bella is a grown woman but behaves like a toddler at first, grunting out words and throwing plates and dancing gleefully around stiff-legged. She calls him God, and that is actually not hyperbole. We will learn the backstory behind all of this in time, and I would not dream of giving any of it away here.<br><br>
                    Godwin is one of several men who try to mold Bella over the course of her development; one of his students, Max McCandles, is another. Max moves in with the intention of assisting Godwin in his research but ends up falling in love with Bella and asking her to marry him, and Youssef brings an element of warmth and reason to this otherwise mad world. But he has no match for Mark Ruffalo, an obvious cad with the very proper name of Duncan Wedderburn, who whisks her away on a lavish world tour.
